## Description

 My motivation to start this project is to gain more experience for my career.

 I built this project because in addition to being a homework haha, it also helped me improve some skills that I had difficulty in both HTML and CSS.

With this site we solve the company's visibility problem.

 With this project I learned how to identify a "duplicate" code, identify links that didn't work and how to improve my CSS with code and comments.

## Installation

-Initiation-

  When we started this project, we had the objective of increasing our visibility, with it we can open new paths for our company to grow.

-Planning-

  We plan to reduce costs by investing in a website with our available budget, but we could take risks if our website was not well built.

-Execution-

  For our plan to be well executed, we need commitment from both employees and company managers. 


## Usage
![alt text](assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

In the first part of the page we have the header, with the project logo and three more links.

Below the header we have an image.

Below we have three "boxes" that were created inside a /section/ element, which show some information about the company.

On the side we have another box with more information about the company that was created inside an /aside/ element.

At the end of the page we have a footer.
